                        <p>
                            I assume you probably are aware of Google Summer of Code (GSoC). In simple terms, it's an
                            opportunity for you to gain real-world project
                            experience where your even a bit of contribution will impact millions of users. You feel
                            proud of it :).
                            <br> You get to connect with an awesome community of developers, always a space to learn
                            from other's experiences.
                            <br><br> And finally, Google helps to connect and bring together student developers who
                            would like to work with the respective organization.
                            You get a decent stipend as well! from google and other perks.

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            Just Start ASAP!, pick an organization!(depends on your interest, if you don't have any,
                            look for some technology you use or have seen people using. It's a personal suggestion as I
                            feel you develop interest if you know even a bit about the Idea/Goal behind an
                            organization).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After you have decided, your first hurdle/goal is to get the Development environment up and
                            running, a.k.a, build the project from the source. It means you will have to use the
                            codebase ( Code) and get the software/service running locally on your system.
                            You can visit the contribution documentation of the organization to help you with that.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            See, not all projects are ~hard, nor all projects are ~easy but, the catch is, you can't
                            overlook and judge this is easy or hard. You will have to come on the same level of
                            understanding to implement a new feature.
                            Again you don't need to grasp the whole codebase, but you should know how the things are
                            plugged in and working.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            So start exploring part by part, and the great way of doing it is to look for the issues
                            marked with the label ~beginer wherever the project is hosted (GitHub, GitLab, etc.). This
                            small-large contribution will also help you to show your work wherever you want.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The good thing about working on a huge codebase is, you find most code/syntax within the
                            codebase. The rest you can ~Google and look for documentation :).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Just try to learn at every step. With honest efforts, you will very soon be very comfortable
                            with the codebase and Vola!!!.

                                I started contributing to pitivi in 2019. I would say I was lucky to find an open
                                feature request, Interactive Intro for Pitivi guiding through parts of the Editor and
                                features. Implemented from scratch but developing things,
                                explored other features/code also while working on this issue, of course with the help
                                of mentors, wherever I got stuck. The only thing I regret, not paying much attention to
                                the Typos. Please use Extentions so that you don't make any typos and
                                to be concise, it will save time for mentors reviewing your code and your time fixing
                                it.

                            <b>The fun fact : </b>I was looking for Multimedia based organization so I initially picked
                            up Musescore, successfully build the project from the source, but I had to install Visual
                            Studio :( then my pc had 2 GB Ram. It was difficult for me to keep up with it. So not all
                            but some
                            projects may require you to have decent PC specifications, so If you can then it's the right
                            time for you to invest and buy a new machine ;)
                            <br> <br>
                            I fixed a typo and made a pull request :). <br>

                            In simple words, we have a new Timeline with minimal UI which will represent the whole
                            timeline view,
                            you can easily track everything without needing to zoom in and zoom out. <br>
                            This will essentially bring in a non-zoomable Timeline which will serve to ease the task of
                            trimming,
                            cutting, rearranging clips on the timeline in sync with the other
                            timeline.
